  title: 'Stock Trend Prediction Using News Analysis',
  date: 'June 2025',
  content: `
    <p>This project applies Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to predict stock market trends by analyzing financial news headlines. Using sentiment analysis techniques on a curated news dataset, the model classifies whether a stock is likely to trend upward or downward — demonstrating the power of combining NLP with financial data science for real-world predictive analytics.</p>

    <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
    <h4>Objective</h4>
    <p>The objective of this project was to build a machine learning pipeline that extracts sentiment signals from financial news headlines and uses them to predict the directional trend of stock prices. This bridges the gap between unstructured text data and quantitative financial forecasting.</p>

    <h4>Process</h4>
    <p>The project was developed in Python using a Jupyter Notebook workflow. News headlines were sourced from a curated dataset (Neews.csv) and preprocessed using NLP techniques including tokenization, stop-word removal, and feature extraction via Bag of Words and TF-IDF vectorization. Sentiment was analyzed using both rule-based and ML-based approaches. Multiple classifiers were trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model for binary trend prediction (bullish/bearish). The pipeline was documented end-to-end in a reproducible Jupyter Notebook.</p>

    <h4>Tools and Technologies Used</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Language: Python</li>
      <li>Environment: Jupyter Notebook</li>
      <li>NLP Libraries:
        <ul>
          <li>NLTK: Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming</li>
          <li>Scikit-Learn: TF-IDF vectorization, model training and evaluation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>ML Models: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression</li>
      <li>Data: Neews.csv — financial news headlines with stock trend labels</li>
      <li>Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn for performance charts</li>
      <li>Version control: GitHub</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Artifact-Specific Value Proposition</h4>
    <h5>Unique Value</h5>
    <p>This project demonstrates my ability to work at the intersection of NLP and financial data science — two highly sought-after domains. It highlights skills in text preprocessing, feature engineering from unstructured data, and applying supervised ML classifiers to solve a real-world prediction problem with measurable business value.</p>

    <h5>Relevance</h5>
    <p>This artifact is directly relevant to roles in data science, quantitative analysis, and fintech — sectors where the ability to extract actionable insights from news and social data is increasingly valued. It showcases my end-to-end ML pipeline skills from raw data to evaluated model.</p>

    <h4>Customization for Audience</h4>
    <h5>Adaptations Made</h5>
    <p>The project was scoped to focus on binary trend classification (up/down) to keep the prediction task clear and measurable. Multiple classifiers were benchmarked to provide comparative insight rather than committing to a single approach, making the analysis more rigorous and informative.</p>

    <h5>Relevance</h5>
    <p>For technical audiences, the notebook provides full reproducibility with documented preprocessing steps and model evaluation. For non-technical stakeholders, the binary trend output (bullish/bearish) is intuitive and directly actionable.</p>

    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    <h5>Significance</h5>
    <p>I chose this project because it combines two disciplines I am deeply interested in — machine learning and financial markets. It demonstrates that meaningful predictive signals can be extracted from raw text data, which has significant implications for algorithmic trading, investment research, and market intelligence.</p>

    <h5>Lessons Learned</h5>
    <p>This project reinforced the importance of thoughtful text preprocessing for NLP tasks. I learned how feature representation choices (Bag of Words vs TF-IDF) significantly impact model performance, and how class imbalance in financial datasets can mislead accuracy metrics — making precision, recall, and F1-score more reliable evaluation tools.</p>

    <h4>Feedback and Revisions</h4>
    <h5>Feedback</h5>
    <p>Feedback focused on improving feature richness beyond simple word frequency, exploring deep learning approaches for sentiment, and testing on live news data for generalizability.</p>

    <h5>Revisions</h5>
    <p>I refined the preprocessing pipeline to include bigrams for richer context, added comparative model evaluation with classification reports, and structured the Jupyter Notebook with clear section headings for reproducibility and readability.</p>

      <p>This machine learning project focuses on classifying exoplanets based on their detection methods using orbital and physical characteristics sourced from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The study compares three algorithmic approaches — Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks (Keras/TensorFlow) — to determine the most effective method for multi-class exoplanet classification.</p>

      <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
      <h4>Objective</h4>
      <p>The goal was to build a robust classification pipeline capable of automatically categorizing exoplanets by their discovery method (11 distinct categories including Transit and Radial Velocity) using physical and orbital features such as orbital period, planetary mass, equilibrium temperature, and insolation flux.</p>

      <h4>Process</h4>
      <p>The workflow began with data collection from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (38,090 records, 100 columns). Key preprocessing steps included KNN imputation for missing values, feature standardization, and exploratory data analysis. Three models were trained and evaluated: Random Forest, XGBoost, and a deep Neural Network. SHAP methodology was used for feature importance analysis on the neural network. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores.</p>

      <h4>Tools and Technologies Used</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Language: Python (Jupyter Notebook)</li>
        <li>ML Libraries: scikit-learn, XGBoost, Keras/TensorFlow</li>
